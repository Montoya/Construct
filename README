This is the code behind constructyourcss.com. 

I built the site many years ago to prove that a visual layout editor could be built to produce semantic HTML and CSS, as well as to provide a foundation for future tools to be built. 

Now (March 5, 2010) I am releasing this code to the public so others can build on it. I should have done this a long time ago, but better late than never.
